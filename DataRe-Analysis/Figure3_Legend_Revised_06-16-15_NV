Figure 3: Identifiability of the three resource types was determined in journal articles that reported RRIDs (post-pilot), and in articles from the same journals before the pilot started (from approximately Januaryâ€“March 2013, pre-pilot). Resources (primary antibodies, organisms, and tools) were considered identifiable if they contained an accurate RRID or by using the same criteria as described in Vasilevsky et al., 2013 (PMID: 24032093). For software and databases (which were not previously analyzed), these resources were considered identifiable if they contained an RRID or reported the manufacturer and version number. The total number of resources for each type is: primary antibodies pre-pilot, n = 140; primary antibodies post-pilot, n = 436; organisms pre-pilot, n = 58; organisms post-pilot, n = 135; tools pre-pilot, n = 176; non-commercial tools post-pilot, n = 98. The y-axis is the average for each resource type. Variation from this average is shown by the bars: error bars indicate upper and lower 95% confidence intervals. Asterisks indicate significant difference by a z-score greater than 1.96.
